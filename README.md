I'm a **creative web developer** and **UX/UI designer** with a strong background in sound engineering and a passion for teaching. With over 15 years of experience in the entertainment industry as a live and studio sound engineer, I've worked on countless shows, concerts, and events worldwide.

🎨 My creativity shines through in my work, where I combine technical skills with artistic flair to create visually stunning and user-friendly interfaces for clients across various industries.

👨‍🏫 As a dedicated educator, I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and empowering others to achieve their goals. I'm always eager to help others learn and grow, whether through workshops, courses, or one-on-one mentorship.

🚀 I'm a true innovator, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and create. Drawing inspiration from my passion for music, technology, and creativity, I think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions for my clients.

🌟 My dedication to sharing knowledge and empowering others through education and mentorship is a testament to my belief that everyone has the potential to achieve their creative vision.
